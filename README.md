2. Example Query: Fetch a list of small_scale manufacturers onboarded on Makersharks, located in India, and having the capability to perform 3d_printing.
3. Expected Response: The API should return a list of manufacturers matching the given criteria, including their supplier_id, company_name, website, location, nature_of_business, and manufacturing_processes.
